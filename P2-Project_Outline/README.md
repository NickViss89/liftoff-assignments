## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Many people are using a lot of different platforms to sell items either recovered from other people's collections or handmade
items. My app will allow for those sellers to keep track of all items with photos as well as price and profit for each. The best
part is that it will allow for users to localize all of their items across all selling platforms and will have all sales
 info available at the click of a button.
 The metrics that this app would keep track of would be cost, asking price, sale price, which platforms each item is listed on,
 which platform the item sold on.
 This idea came from my girlfriend who has many items for sale across many platforms. there really wasn't a way to keep track
 of all of the items nor was there a way to track income from the sales.
### Features
Multiple users with different info for each, password protected and a personal home page for each.
Photos of stored items, every item will have a stored photo or two that will make it easier to distinguish which item is in question.
Search feature which will allow for the user to search their item being sold by name, platform, and ID number.
metrics page with info about all parts of the business
